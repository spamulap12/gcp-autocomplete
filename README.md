# E-Shopping AutoComplete Example

Code created for a special project to perform a dataflow computing job via the Google Cloud Platform. This project will take an input file with product names per line and output a DB table with prefixes and potential product names that can be used for low latency auto complete.

Please take into consideration I am an absolute noob with Apache BEAM coding paradigm, so use this code at your own risk.
